* Revisiting project; trying to remember where I was at!
* Thoughts : Need a coherent logger structure
* Also need to make things as automated and as intuitive as I can.
* Iterative improvements of the model should be documented, etc.
* Build modular code so that it can be extended to all fields as easily as possible.
* Integrate with the existing python system as much as possible

* Working on **label_candidates.py** -- should just integrate with the vislc program you wrote...
	* **done**(?) not tested...
* Link of possible interest: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~szheng/CRFasRNN.html
* **snag** the Visualizer can only work with the Gzipped csv files and not the raw lightcurves.
	* This means that I have to do an awkward `fetch_lcs()` call, ostensibly while on Della, when the data might be right there or accessible in other, faster ways. The `fetch_lcs` call gets the files via an 
	http GET request. This will be MUCH slower than `scp`/`rsync` from the LC server...
		* Talk to Waqas!!!
* Should have a seamless way to just fetch a lightcurve -- the module/function should be able to deal with `.tfalc`, `csv.gz`, etc. Maybe it could just return a standardized dictionary of information
* Debugging the `create_initial_labeled_hatids.py` script; what a nightmare.
