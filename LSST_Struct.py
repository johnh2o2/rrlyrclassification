class Struct(object):
    """!A struct to which you can add any fields
    
    Intended to be used for the return value from Task.run and other Task methods,
    and useful for any method that returns multiple values.
    The intent is to allow accessing returned items by name, instead of unpacking a tuple.
    This makes the code much more robust and easier to read. It allows one to change what values are returned
    without inducing mysterious failures: adding items is completely safe, and removing or renaming items
    causes errors that are caught quickly and reported in a way that is easy to understand.
    The primary reason for using Struct instead of dict is that the fields may be accessed as attributes,
    e.g. aStruct.foo instead of aDict["foo"]. Admittedly this only saves a few characters, but it makes
    the code significantly more readable.
    Struct is preferred over named tuples, because named tuples can be used as ordinary tuples, thus losing
    all the safety advantages of Struct. In addition, named tuples are clumsy to define and Structs
    are much more mutable (e.g. one can trivially combine Structs and add additional fields).
